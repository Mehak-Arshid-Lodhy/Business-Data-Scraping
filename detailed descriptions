### **Detailed Description of the Python Script for Business Data Scraping**

#### **Objective**
This Python script is designed to scrape business details such as name, location, team members, emails, and phone numbers from Google and LinkedIn based on input criteria (business category and location). It uses a combination of APIs, web scraping, and manual input to gather and process data. The script is designed to meet the requirements outlined in **Task 2**.

---

### **Features Implemented**

#### **1. Input Variables**
- The script allows users to define:
  - **Business Category**: The type of businesses to search for (e.g., "digital marketing agencies").
  - **Location**: The primary location for the search (e.g., "Abbottabad, Pakistan").
  - **Fallback Location**: A secondary location to search if the primary location yields no results.

#### **2. Google Scraping**
- **Primary Method**: Uses the **Google Places API** to fetch business details such as name, address, website, and phone number.
- **Fallback Method**: If the API fails, the script uses **Selenium** to scrape Google search results.
- **Manual Input**: If both methods fail, the script allows users to manually input Google search results, which are processed using the **Gemini API**.

#### **3. LinkedIn Scraping**
- Due to LinkedIn's restrictions on automated scraping, the script provides a manual input mode for LinkedIn employee data (name, job title, email), which is processed using the **Gemini API**.

#### **4. Data Cleaning & Storage**
- The script validates and cleans the collected data to remove duplicates and irrelevant entries.
- The cleaned data is saved in both **CSV** and **JSON** formats for easy access and further processing.

#### **5. Ethical Compliance**
- The script uses **user-agent rotation** and supports **proxies** to prevent detection and blocking.
- It limits the number of results fetched from Google to 5 businesses to comply with ethical scraping practices.

#### **6. Automation**
- The script includes a scheduler to perform periodic data scraping at a specified time (e.g., 08:00 daily).

### **Files Generated by the Script**

1. **`business_data.csv`**:
   - A CSV file containing the cleaned and structured business data.
   - Includes fields such as name, address, website, phone number, location, and data source.

2. **`business_data.json`**:
   - A JSON file containing the same data as the CSV file but in a structured JSON format.
   - Useful for integration with other systems or APIs.

3. **`captcha_page_selenium_<query>.html`**:
   - HTML files saved when a CAPTCHA is detected during Selenium scraping.
   - These files are useful for debugging CAPTCHA-related issues.

4. **`captcha_page_requests_<query>.html`**:
   - HTML files saved when a CAPTCHA is detected during requests-based scraping.
   - These files are also useful for debugging.

5. **`final_google_page.html`**:
   - The final HTML page saved when all Google scraping attempts fail.
   - Useful for debugging and analyzing why scraping failed.

### **Why Itâ€™s Not Fully Working**

1. **Google API Limitations**:
   - The script currently uses the **Gemini API** as a free alternative to the **Google Places API** because the Google API is a paid service.
   - The Gemini API generates mock data, which may not always reflect real-world business details.

2. **CAPTCHA Challenges**:
   - Both Google and LinkedIn employ CAPTCHAs to prevent automated scraping.
   - The script does not currently integrate a CAPTCHA-solving service like **2Captcha**, which limits its ability to bypass these challenges.

3. **LinkedIn Restrictions**:
   - LinkedIn has strict policies against automated scraping.
   - The script relies on manual input for LinkedIn data, which is less efficient and requires user intervention.

4. **Limited Data Accuracy**:
   - Since the Gemini API generates mock data, the results may not always be accurate or complete.
   - Without access to the **Google Places API** and **LinkedIn People API**, the script cannot fetch real-time, verified data.

---

### **Alternative Methods Used to Resolve Issues**

1. **Fallback to Selenium for Google Scraping**:
   - When the Google Places API fails, the script uses **Selenium** to scrape Google search results.
   - Selenium automates a Chrome browser to mimic human behavior, including scrolling and waiting, to reduce detection.

2. **Manual Input for Google and LinkedIn Data**:
   - If both the API and Selenium fail, the script allows users to manually input search results or employee data.
   - The **Gemini API** processes this input to extract structured data.

3. **Mock Data Generation with Gemini API**:
   - When no data is available from Google or LinkedIn, the script generates mock business data using the **Gemini API**.
   - This ensures that the script always produces some output, even in the absence of real data.

4. **User-Agent Rotation and Proxies**:
   - The script uses the **fake_useragent** library to rotate user-agent strings, making the browser appear as a real user.
   - It also supports proxies to mask the IP address and reduce the likelihood of being blocked.

5. **Data Cleaning**:
   - The script includes a robust data cleaning function to remove duplicates and irrelevant entries, ensuring the final output is accurate and useful.

### **Future Improvements**

1. **Integrate Google Places API**:
   - Provides accurate and real-time business details.
   - Paid service but highly reliable for business data scraping.

2. **Add CAPTCHA-Solving Service**:
   - Use a service like **2Captcha** to solve CAPTCHAs automatically.
   - This will enable the script to bypass Google and LinkedIn CAPTCHA challenges.

3. **Use LinkedIn People API**:
   - Allows compliant access to LinkedIn data, including employee details.
   - Eliminates the need for manual input and ensures accurate results.

4. **Enhance Data Validation**:
   - Add more robust validation checks to ensure the data is accurate and complete.

### **Conclusion**
This script is a robust foundation for business data scraping, meeting most of the requirements outlined in **Task 2**. However, due to the reliance on the free Gemini API and the lack of CAPTCHA-solving and LinkedIn API integration, it currently has limitations in accuracy and automation. By integrating the **Google Places API**, **2Captcha API**, and **LinkedIn People API**, the script can overcome these challenges and deliver significantly better results.
